#bbc&m.c(My Capstone Project Using C)
This codde begins with the header files which iclude:(a).the standard C libraries
                                                     (b).string manipulation

Global Variables: Arrays are used to store information about bus routes , passenger names , seat numbers , and other related information.

Function Declarations: Several functions are declared to perform specific tasks, such as displaying the bus list , handling user login, booking tickets , displaying the status of seats (status), and others.

Login Function: The login function is used to authenticate users. It prompts the user to enter a username and password. If the entered credentials match predefined values, the user is considered authenticated.

Menu-Driven Interface (main function): The main function represents the main menu of the program. It uses a do-while loop to repeatedly display a menu and execute the chosen option until the user chooses to exit.
Menu options include viewing bus routes, booking tickets, canceling bookings, checking the status of seats, and exiting the program.

Bus Function (bus): Displays a list of available bus routes.
Booking Function (booking): (a).Handles the process of booking bus tickets.
                            (b).Reads the current available seats from a file, allows the user to choose a bus, prompts for the number of tickets to book, and updates the available seats.
Name-Number Function (name_number): Takes care of storing passenger names and corresponding booking numbers in files.

Read-Number and Read-Name Functions (read_number and read_name):Retrieve booking numbers and passenger names from files, respectively.

Status Functions (status and status_1):Display the status of booked and available seats based on user input.
                                       status_1 is used during the booking process to display the current status.

Cancel Function (cancle):Allows users to cancel booked tickets, updates the status, and returns a hypothetical booking amount.

File Operations:The program uses file operations (fopen, fclose, fgets, fputs, fprintf, etc.) to read and write data related to seat availability, passenger names, and booking numbers.

User Interface: -The program interacts with users through a console-based menu system.
                -The getch function is used to wait for a keypress before continuing, providing a pause in the program execution.

Exit Message:When the user chooses to exit, a closing message is displayed.
Clearing the Screen (system("cls")):The program uses system to clear the console screen, providing a cleaner user interface.
